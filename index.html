    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    
      <p><img src="images/what-is-an-olymp-swimming-pool.jpg" alt="Swimming Pool">One of my favorite hobbies to do outside of school is swimming, because I get to hang out with friends at practice. At meets, I usually swim the 50 and 100 yard freestyle, but I don’t like to go to meets because I have to wake up very early. In my free time, I like to play video games on my laptop and phone. However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Intel-i3-1005G1-3-4GHz-Laptop/dp/B089T6C53P?th=1" target="_blank">my laptop</a> often cannot run very large games with high graphics properly because it is not meant for gaming, and it does not have enough storage space left. <span class="bold">My favorite thing to do on the weekend is hiking with my family because I get to spend time outdoors and with my family.</span></p>

    <h3>Favorite Food</h3>
      <p><img src="images/images.jpeg" alt="In-N-Out" id="pic2">My favorite fast food restaurant is <a href="https://www.in-n-out.com" target="_blank">In-N-Out</a>, because their burger sauce is very tasty, and their ingredients all taste very fresh. In my opinion, <span class="highlight">the best part of an In-N-Out burger are the onions</span>, because they add a satisfying crunch to every bite. I also like New York Pizza, because it is not overly cheesy, and the crust is very crispy, like a potato chip. If I were to choose any food to eat for the rest of my life, it would be sushi, because there are lots of varieties so I wouldn’t get bored of eating the same thing every meal. My favorite kind of sushi is the California roll, because you can taste all of the fresh ingredients clearly.</p>

    <h3>Travels</h3>
      <p><img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="NYC">I like to travel because it is fun experiencing places that are very different from San Diego. I have been to almost every national park in California, and many others around the US. My favorite trip was to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" target="_blank">Yellowstone</a>, because the geysers and wildlife were very fun to watch. My most recent trip was to <span class = "underline">New York</span>, where I got to eat lots of good food. In the future, I wish to travel to places outside of the US to experience different cultures.</p>
